  <title>What is SENECA?</title> 
  <para> SENECA is a program package for Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE). 
  	It attempts to find the constitution of an unknown molecule upon 
	evidence from spectroscopic data, in particular from NMR.
  </para> 
  <para>
        Based on Jean-Loup Faulons stochastic structure generator, guided to an optimum by 
	simulated annealing <xref linkend="FAU96"/>, it is pricipally capable of searching larger 
	constitutional spaces than the common deterministic algorithms.
  </para>
  <para>A typical set of information used to prepare a structure elucidation run consists of 
	 <itemizedlist> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>the molecular formula of the unknown compound, typically deduced from 
		  high-resolution mass spectrocmetry.</para> 
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		<para>1D carbon nmr data (broadband-decoupled carbon nmr, DEPT-90 and DEPT 135)</para> 
		</listitem> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para><superscript>1</superscript>J<subscript>CH</subscript> NMR correlation data, 
		  like CH COSY, HMQC, HSQC</para> 
		</listitem> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>long-range CH or NH correlation data from HMBC, NH HMBC</para> 
		</listitem> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>HH correlation data, in particular but not limited to <superscript>3</superscript>
		  J<subscript>HH</subscript> coupling information.</para> 
		</listitem>

		  support for Chemical Markup Language
			 (CML) <xref linkend="PMR99"/>.</para> 
		</listitem> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>Automated Structure Layout, also known as Structure Diagram

	<title>Why Open-Source?</title>
	<para>
		Firstly, it is an hommage to the scientific culture of releasing your 
		results in complete detail - an endangered culture, by the way.
	</para>
	<para>
		Secondly, SENECA has an completely open arcitecture which enables it to use
		all kinds of spectrocopic data and allows for the plugin of other types of 
		structure generators.
	</para>
	<para>
		It is thus highly desirable to have as many scientists as possible 
		contribute to the growth of this system. Since the source code is open
		to the public and everyone is free to use SENECA in his/her daily work, 
		there is an incentive for those who use this free software, to give 
		something back to the community.

  <title>How can I participate?</title> 
  <para> SENECA is mantained as a 
	 <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</ulink> project under 
	 <ulink
	 url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/seneca">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/seneca</ulink>.
	 Please check the 
	 <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge site
		documentation</ulink> for more. SourceForge gives us bugtracking, mailing
	 lists, support manager and last not least CVS access. </para> 
  <para>There is more than one way to participate: 
	 <itemizedlist> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>You can participate in the dicussion lists, by making
			 recommendations for new features, submitting bug reports, give 
			 scientific advice, etc.</para> 
		</listitem> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>You can write documentation.</para> 
		</listitem> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>You can write source code.</para> 
		</listitem> 
	 </itemizedlist></para> 
  <para>Each of these possibility is equally deserving, although most people
	 rank coding highest.</para> 
  <para> If you want to write documentation or start coding, please check the 
	 <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</ulink> site
	 documentation on how to access the CVS. If you actively want to contribute,
	 please get a SourceForge account, contact the project admin so that he can add
	 you to the developers list. The next step would be to checkout the source code
	 </para>
