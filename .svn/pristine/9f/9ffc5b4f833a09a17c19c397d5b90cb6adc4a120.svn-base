		<para> The project reference is supposed to be a compendium for all kind
		  of information related to the SENECA project, as there are questions
		  regarding the program design, how to document things or what to do in order to
		  update the web pages.</para> 
		<para>Since the development of SENECA is performed as an open-source
		  project, all developers are volunteers.
		  Developers come and go and if they come, this Project reference is
		  the first point to start reading. As has been mentioned before, the 
		  <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">SourceForge site
			 documentation</ulink>is a valuable starting point to see what services - all
		  related to the needs of open-source projects or software projects in general -
		  are provided. For each project hosted by SourceForge, email distribution lists,
		  aka mailing lists, can be created for the communication between the developers
		  and the users. Successive versions, actually even daily changes in the code can
		  be administrated and tracked by the 
		  <ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/">Concurrent Versions System
			 (CVS)</ulink>. CVS provides the possibility to access an arbitraty point in
		  time in the history of your code changes. It keeps track of the question of who
		  changed what in which of the code modules and it even can sometimes resolve the
		  situation the two developers changed something in the same code file and
		  commited these changes to the repository.The docs on 
		  <ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org/">http://www.cvshome.org</ulink> are
		  certainly a must for each developer who wants to become part of an open-source
		  project, certainly if it's hosted by 
		  <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</ulink>. </para> 
		<para>Usefull tools like the Bug Tracker and the Support Manager - the
		  functions should be obvious - complete the set of 
		  <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</ulink>
		  services.</para>
