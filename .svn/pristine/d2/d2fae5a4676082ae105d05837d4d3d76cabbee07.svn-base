HISTORY
Christoph Steinbeck (11. Dec. 2000) 

This folder contains the complete documentation of the SENECA project (http://seneca.sourceforge.net),
including the doc sources. The philosophy for this docu is to have a single 
set of XML documents from which different "views", as as there currently are
the website and the PDF manual, are produced using XSLT transformation 
stylesheets.
So far, we have to use some unavoidable wrapper XML docs for each of the views,
but a good customization of the XSLT stylesheets might be able to change this.

So, what you need in order to produce the docs after makeing changes to the 
XML source is:

- The latest version of the XSLT processor XALAN together with the XML parser 
  XERCES from http://xml.apache.org
- The latest docbook.dtd from http://www.docbook.org
- The latest docbook and website XSLT stylesheets written by Norman Walsh from 
  http://www.nwalsh.com

Please have a look at $SENECAHOME/doc/source/bin/makeWebsite.bat
$XML_HOME is where Norm's (almost) unmodified XSLT stylesheets reside.
In $SENECAHOME/doc/source/lib/ you'll find the customization stylesheet 
senecawebsite.xsl, which you'll need to edit to point to the correct stylesheet 
chunk-tabular.xsl in Norm's website XSLT distribution.
Unfortunatly, there's also a link in Norm's website.xsl pointing to the 
docbook.xsl stylesheet of Norm's docbook XSLT sheets which you'll need to fix.
So it needs some editing in the original XSLT stylesheets, whereas the idea 
should be to have all the customization done in one document and leave the 
original sheets as they are.

Anyway, maybe we'll get to this point later.

The batch files should now be self-explanatory. 
Unfortunatly, the HTML will be placed in the bin dir, so you've to copy
it to the htdocs directory in order to make them work.

As soon as you're done with testing, you should update the seneca CVS on 
Sourceforge with the new docu and the upload the docs to 
seneca.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/htdocs

You can do this using secure copy. Go to your local htdocs directory and do

scp -r * yourusername@seneca.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/htdocs

Please check if what you've done works and correct any problem immediately.
